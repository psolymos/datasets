# dolina data set

## Summary

A comprehensive and micro-scale land snail data set from 16 dolines of the
Aggtelek Karst Area, Hungary, as described in Kemecei et al. 2014.

## Methods for Molluscs

Land snails were sampled during daylight hours between
16 and 18 of August, 2007. Samples were taken from four
microhabitat types:
litter, trunks of live trees, dead wood (also known as coarse woody debris), 
and rock.

In each of the 16 dolina, seven samples were collected in the litter microhabitat
along a north-south transect. In the case of the other three
microhabitat types, samples were collected from three random
locations per microhabitat type in each dolina.
A total of 256 samples were
collected, each consisting 2 sub-samples collected
by 2 sampling methods: litter samples (Q) and timed search (T).

One liter of litter samples including topsoil were collected
to be examined later in the laboratory. Litter samples were
collected adjacent to live wood, dead wood and rocks, and
not from the wood or rocks themselves. Litter samples in the
litter microhabitat were not collected near wood or rocks
(minimum distance of 2 meters). During 5 minutes per site of
time-restricted direct search we investigated microhabitats in
a 1 meter radius circle around the litter sample location, but
also including tree or rock surfaces.

The vertical zone (bottom, middle or edge of the dolinas),
aspect of these sample locations,
along with litter depth, and litter moisture (scored on an ordinal scale: 1=dry,
2=fresh, 3=moist) were also recorded.

Individuals were categorized based on being alive or
dead (empty shells with different levels of shell deterioration.

## Methods for Isopods

Manual samplings have taken place between 

16th and 18th August, 2007. We have chosen 16 do-
lines of similar traits (Table 1). During time sam-
pling, two persons (F. V. and A. N.) have collected 
isopods for 20 minutes in each site, spending 120 
minutes with sampling altogether in each doline. 
Time sampling provides data eligible in respect of 
quantitative data analyses.
